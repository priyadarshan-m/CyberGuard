## üéØ Gameplay & Objective

The objective is to guide the Cyber Guardian through 5 increasingly difficult levels. To complete a level, the player must:

1.  **Collect all Security Tokens:** Each level contains several collectible items, such as Firewalls, Antivirus software, and VPN keys. You must collect all of them to enable access to the final goal.
2.  **Learn as You Play:** Every time you collect a token, a helpful cybersecurity tip appears, explaining the importance of that security concept.
3.  **Avoid Cyber Threats:** The digital world is filled with enemies representing viruses, malware, spyware, and more. Contact with them will force you to respawn.
4.  **Navigate Treacherous Platforms:** Jump over deadly spikes and navigate moving, falling, and disappearing platforms to traverse the level.
5.  **Reach the Goal:** Once all security tokens are collected, make your way to the main server at the end of the level to secure it and advance to the next challenge.
